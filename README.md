Azure Storage Admin
===================

Web viewer and manager for Microsoft Azure storage services:

* Tables
* Queues
* Blobs

**Note:** Here you can find the source code. If you want to use Azure Storage Admin just login on [www.azurestorageadmin.com](http://azurestorageadmin.raffaelegaito.com).

## Why Azure Storage Admin?

There are several Windows tools to manage Azure storage services, free and not. Even in Visual Studio is possibile to manage databases.

But... **there are no tools for linux and MacOS**!

A webapp is the solution!

The first version is just a **viewer**, the final idea is to create a **complete manager** like phpMyAdmin for MySQL.

## Usage

There are two ways to use Azure Storage Admin:

* On-line, directly on the [official website](http://azurestorageadmin.raffaelegaito.com). Just login with your Azure credentials and start use it.
* Off-line, downloading it and running it on your machine with the command
`node app.js`.
